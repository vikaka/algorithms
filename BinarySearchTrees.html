                What is a binary search tree?

                <b>Worst case:</b> &Theta;(n)
                <br>
                This occurs when the tree simply makes one long chain.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Average case:</b> &Theta;(lg n)
                <br>
                That is because the expected height of a randomly built binary
                search tree is O(lg n).

                Querying a binary search tree
            </h2>
            <p>
                Why do we pass in a node rather than the tree itself?
                <br>
                Note why CLRS pseudo-code for max and min contains mistake
                from practical point of view.
                <br>
                Library code versus application code.
                <br>
                Library must protect itself against both malicious and merely
                inept users. So, need to check for NIL input!
                <br>
                <br>
                Recursive versus loop: compare the two searches.
                <br>
                <br>
                All searching functions (search, minimum, maximum, predecessor,
                successor run in <em>O(h)</em> time, where <em>h</em> is the height of
                the tree.

            <h3>
                Search
            </h3>
            <p>
                We search by starting with the root node. If it's key is equal
                to the key for which we are searching, we are done: that is the
                key we want.
                <br>
                On the other hand, if we have a NIL node at hand, we are also done,
                but have failed to find the key.
                <br>
                Finally, if neither is true, we check the key at hand against
                the key sought for.
                <ul>
                    <li>If k &lt; curr.key, recursively call tree search on curr.left.
                    <li>Else recursively call tree search on curr.right.
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                <b>Example:</b>
                <br>Let's search for 4 in the tree above.
                <ul>
                    <li>4 &lt; 8; move left
                    <li>4 &gt; 3; move right
                    <li>4 &lt; 6; move left
                    <li>Voila!
                </ul>
            </p>

            
            <h3>
                Minimum and maximum
            </h3>

            <p>
            To find the minimum, we simply walk down the left side of the tree.
            <br>
            To find the maximum, we simply walk down the right side of the tree.
            </p>


            <h3>
                Successor
            </h3>
            <p>
                Similarly, let's walk through successor for our tree above.
                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine we are seeking the successor of 3. The right tree of
                three is non-empty. So we simply seek the minimum of that tree,
                which is the leftmost node in the tree, in this case, 4.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, take this tree, and start with node 10.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Let's walk through insert for tree 1 above.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will insert 5. (When I say "Insert x," you should take that
                to be shorthand for "Insert a node with key x.")
                <ul>
                    <li>5 &lt; 8, so we move left.
                    <li>5 &gt; 3, so we move right. 
                    <li>5 &lt; 6, so we move left.
                    <li>5 &gt; 4, so we move right and insert. 
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>
                Delete
            </h3>
            <p>
                Deletion is by far the most complicated coding of any of these
                functions. There are four cases (and z is the node to delete):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                <li>z has no left child. (This handles two cases!)
                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Replace z by its right child, which might be
                    NIL.
                <li>z has only a left child.
                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Replace z by its left child.
                <li>z has two children.
                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Find z's successor y, which lies in its
                    right sub-tree.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If y is z's right child, replace z by y.
                        <li>Otherwise, replace y by its own right child, then
                            replace z by y.
                    </ul>

            </ol>
            <p>
                Let's walk through deleting 8 in tree 2 above.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 has two children, so we are in case 4.
                <li>The successor of 8 is 9.
                <li>9 is not the right child of 8.
                <li>So we replace 9 by 10.
                <li>Then we replace 8 by 9.
            </ul>
            <p>
            The right half of tree 2 now looks like this:

            <h2>
                Randomly built binary search trees
            </h2>
            <p>
                We insert the keys randomly. (We would have to have all keys at
                hand at the start, and then do a random shuffle on the set of
                keys.) The expected height of such a tree is O(lg n).
                <br>
                <br>
                This handles the situation where we believe we might get handed
                input that is already sorted, which would create a worst-case
                scenario.

                <li>For the first tree above, write the steps that will take place
                    when we insert 11.
                <li>Write recursive versions of TREE-MINIMUM and
                    TREE-MAXIMUM.
                <li>Compare the deletion of the node with key == 8
                    in Tree 2 that takes place following our
                    textbook's algorithm with what the first visualizer linked
                    to above actually does in this situation. Clearly, two
                    different binary trees result. What algorithm is being used
                    by the visualizer? (You could build different trees and see
                    what it does: this is called <b>reverse engineering</b>.)
                    If both algorithms always build valid BSTs, is there some
                    reason we should prefer one algorithm or the other?
                <li>Some problems involving the sequence of nodes examined,
                    where nodes will be inserted, etc.
