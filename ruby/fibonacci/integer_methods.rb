# THESE METHODS RESEMBLE TEXTBOOK PSEUDO CODE OR PROFESSOR CALLAHAN'S PYTHON CODE

# NOTE: This kind of dynamic method addition to in-built classes is called
#       MONKEY PATCHING(that's right) and its beautiful when done carefully
#       This implementation does not factor in that safety.

# HAPPY MONKEY PATCHING!

# Public: Extended Integer class methods for easy execution of fibonacci
#         Methods are invoked on an integer
#
# Examples
#
#   40.cool_iterative_fib
#   # => 102334155
class Integer

  # Internal: Calculates the nth fibonacci of a number iteratively
  #           Iterative summation strategy
  # Uses Ruby's infamous INJECT method. Please checkout how it works. It's awsome
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   40.cool_fib
  #   => 102334155
  #
  # Returns a number.
  def cool_fib
    (0..self).inject([1,0]) {|i_arr| [i_arr.last, i_arr.first + i_arr.last]}.first
  end

  # Internal: Calculates the nth fibonacci of a number exhaustively and redundantly
  #           Recursive strategy
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   40.naive_fib
  #   => 102334155
  #
  # Returns a number.
  def naive_fib
    return -1 if self < 0
    return 0 if self == 0
    return 1 if self == 1
    (self-1).naive_fib + (self-2).naive_fib
  end

  # Internal: Calculates the nth fibonacci of a number using an auxiliary lookup structure
  #           Recursive memoized strategy
  #
  # number - Number of Fibonacci to be found
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   40.memo_fib
  #   => 102334155
  #
  # Returns a number.
  def memo_fib(hash={})
    return -1 if self < 0
    return 0 if self == 0
    return 1 if self == 1

    prev_fib = hash[self-1] || (hash[self-1] = (self-1).memo_fib(hash))
    prev_prev_fib = hash[self-2] || (hash[self-2] = (self-2).memo_fib(hash))

    prev_fib + prev_prev_fib
  end

  # Internal: Calculates the nth fibonacci of a number iteratively
  #           Iterative summation strategy
  #
  # number - Number of Fibonacci to be found
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   40.iter_fib
  #   => 102334155
  #
  # Returns a number.
